# Client Acquisition Strategy
## AKA, how can I help you?

This is a big one: client acquisition. Being a freelancer, finding people to work with you is no longer as trivial as accepting an assignment from your super. In the beginning, and when the "work pipeline" starts to run dry - actively searching for clients is a must. But this makes many people uncomfortable. 

I didn't want to be the cold-caller. I didn't want to have to hear, "sorry, I'm not interested. \*click\*." Didn't want to have a script. I wanted real conversation. Ideally, I wanted to talk to people who are already enthusiastic about working with me, but that obviously wasn't very realistic.

I soon realized I was trying to answer the same question asked by every single (ethical) company out there: "*How do I reach the people who genuinely want what I'm offering?*" How do I advertise myself, and how do I do it efficiently?

I initially thought: BULK. Let's make flyers and post them everywhere. We'll let statistics - and a little bit of luck - do all the heavy lifting. Then I tried to remember the last time I called a number from a flyer posted on a local stop-sign. Yeah, never. So, next!

Spamming flyers and phone calls is a garbage tactic that both annoys potential clients, comes off as unprofessional, and frankly - I just don't want to do it. It was too impersonal. 

So then, let's get personal! My next nugget of a *client acquisition strategy* went something like this: I'll go to door-to-door with a stack of business cards and a pitch. If they're willing to listen, I'd offer some sort of promotional rate, free wireframe, etc. And hey, I'm a local, so they have to like me...right?

Eh, not really. 

### It didn't take long to see the cons of this approach:

**It's unreliable**: what if the business owners are out at lunch? What if they're having a bad day? Enough said.

**It's tiring & inefficient**: Not a deal-breaker, but not ideal. Having my primary client acquisition strategy depend on physically walking all over town was not only slow, but it would take more energy than it's worth.

**It's inconsistent**: I'm not a professional orator. Even with a script, I'm not going to be able to deliver the same exact pitch over and over, to dozens of clients. It'll be draining, mentally tiring, and pretty demoralizing if I get hit with a bunch of "NO"s. It'd be very possible that I accidentally omit a huge chunk of information without realizing it. 

**It hurts the client**: It's their place of work, where time is literally money. By walking into their store and requesting their time and attention, I'm effectively stealing their focus - and their money.

I suppose I could simply arrange meetings instead of trying to deliver my pitch on the spot, but considering the rapidly-stacking cons, I decided it was time to move on. So how could I adjust this plan? I *liked* the idea of being more personal with them, because it would show that I care enough to do so. I *disliked* the inefficiency, inflexibility, and burden placed on the client to listen to my pitch when they probably just want to work.


## AND FOR MY NEXT TRICK, I will adapt my client acquisition strategy to better suit the needs of the client!


Yay.

**The New Plan**: I'll choose 3-5 local businesses, write a personalized letter - along with some sort of promotional deal, perhaps - and create a little packet of materials for each client so they can thumb through my portfolio, get an idea of my rates, etc. 

The advantages were plentiful. 

### This way, business owners can:
- Read my "pitch" at their leisure.
- Feel less pressured (and therefore resistant) to the idea of spontaneously working with me.
- Still feel like they're being individually appreciated, rather than being spammed.

### Additionally:
- I can take my time preparing a personalized letter for each business, instead of having to adapt my pitch on-the-spot.
- I don't have to work myself physically; I can devote more energy to doing "work that matters," instead of just walking around from door-to-door.
- I generally have more control and organization over the process.

No spam, no tacky pitch. Just a straightforward proposal to work together, an easy-to-understand promotion to sweeten the deal, and some *next steps*, should they want to proceed to actually work with me. A week after I send it, a follow-up letter or phone call to either push the deal through or to wish them luck. Ethical, friendly, personalized, and open. And hey, if they ever want to do web work in the future, they'll have a name on-hand. Wins all around.

I want to do business the way business should be done. And I think this method really achieves that.

While I get my business cards printed (from [Moo](http://moo.com)!), I'll mull over the strategy and see how it goes. They arrive in about a week. I'm excited.

Best,
