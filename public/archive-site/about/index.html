        <p>Hi, I'm Kevin Oh.</p>
        <p>
            First, the formal breakdown. I'm a web developer by trade whose comfortable at every point in the web stack (LEMP), as long I'm wearing my lucky hoodie. I've been working primarily with the Laravel framework, but have worked with other PHP frameworks, such as CodeIgniter, as well as Ruby on Rails. I'm not a MEAN person, though. Heh. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyways, some more: I believe the best way to learn is to dive in. I find the world of web development grotesquely fascinating and get hyped everytime I receive the <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/versioning/">Versioning Newsletter</a> in my inbox. I Reddit and Spotify. I have approximately 14030151053 private repositories dedicated to personal projects I've never finished, but don't worry, I'll get around to it. Bad documentation causes my cells to undergo violent apoptosis - although sometimes it's impossible to tell whether it's the docs that are bad - or me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I type "npm install" then tilt my screen at cafes to impress strangers.
        </p>
        <p>Random list of things I can't live without:</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>SCSS/SASS</li>
            <li>Oh My Zsh</li>
            <li>Vim Keybindings</li>
            <li>Chrome Dev Tools</li>
            <li>Hallal Food</li>
            <li>Stickers</li>
            <li>Github</li>
            <li>The excellent <a href="http://laracasts.com">Laracasts </a> resource.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I'm also terrible at writing about myself.
        </p>
        <p>Anyways, some final notes: Sublime Text 3 is the best, and Jeffrey Way, Taylor Otwell, and Simon Allardice are beautiful people.</p>
