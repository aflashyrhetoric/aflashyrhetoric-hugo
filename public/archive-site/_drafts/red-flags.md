# How To Find A Reliable Design Agency
### Unethical design/web shops exist. Let's talk about that.

Now, before anything else: I'm not saying that high rates are criminal. **Graphic design** and **web design/development** are highly nuanced fields. Professionals who work diligently to hone their skills and honor best practices deserve proper compensation. I stand by this.

But that's not always the case. Far from it. Let me tell you a few horror stories. All true.

(Names changed because I don't want to get sued.)

## Case #1
Sarah is approached by a local design agency called SketchPup Designs. SketchPup publishes a bi-annual publication featuring all the local businesses in the area. Their offer to Sarah goes something like this: 

## "For the low price of $500, we'll design a high-quality custom flyer, which we'll then include in our own popular publication. We'll spread this awesome publication to folks all over the region."

Sarah is intrigued, sees some of their past work, and decides to go with it. In fact, it seems like it could be a good value. Some time goes by, and SketchPup finally returns with the flyer that they've designed. 

Her heart sinks. The "high-quality custom flyer" is the size of a small index card. Illegible text with typos, obnoxious electric-blue banners, thick beveled borders. Microsoft WordArt is plastered across the center, and for some reason, the background is a texture-image of red marble. The flyer looks like it was made for a tiling company. **Sarah runs an interior decorating business.**

It looks nothing like the flyers she'd been shown as part of SketchPup's past-work portfolio a few weeks prior. The so-called "publication" is little more than a dinky coupon book. The kind you use for kindling when cooking smores. 

Sarah, ever the mature businesswoman, decides to write off the incident as a lesson learned, albeit a $500 one. She strongly dislikes the flyer's design, but she knows that her target audience is a bit older - a crowd that's overall less likely to fret over design choices - and decides to run with it. 

"They'll be distributed next week to hundreds of people all over the county - you'll get great exposure!"

Well, at least there's that. After all, marketing skillfully to target demographics is a tiresome business, and if they can do it for her, then great. Silver lining.

Next week, she gets a stack of ten SketchPup coupon books dropped off unceremoniously at her storefront. This service didn't distribute it to customers who may be interested, they simply printed some booklets out and gave it back to store owners to distribute themselves.

Sarah had paid $500 for a sloppy flyer that was thrown together with Microsoft Word.

She calls SketchPup to express her disapproval. They try to upsell her by offering her a website package for $250 per page.

**Who Is To Blame?**
