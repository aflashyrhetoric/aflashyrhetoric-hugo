    description: "ADELIE is the web development & graphic design agency I co-founded in January 2016. The website was designed and hand-coded from scratch in Laravel. Laravel was chosen over more conventional alternatives (IE: WordPress/SquareSpace) so that the site could be used for more than serving static pages in the future. Currently, another internal side-project is being planned that will utilize this flexibility."
