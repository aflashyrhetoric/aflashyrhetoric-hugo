# The Ethics Of Choice in Web Development
<br>

## First, The Good.
In the past five years or so, the web development scene has seen a surge of new technologies that simplify the process of building complicated websites. Many of the technical, lower-level aspects of web development are abstracted away into neat little libraries. This has made many developers very happy. 

### Unfortunately, the same isn't always true for the clients.

In fact, the opposite can be true.

The job of a web developer is (more or less) as follows. First, assess the client's needs. 
Second, consider solutions to the problem that leverage the power of the web. 
Third, work to implement these solutions - create useable deliverables for the client. 

The first and third steps are just matters of communication and hard work, respectively. They're still highly nuanced tasks, of course, but ethics doesn't really come into play.

It's during the second step - considering and deciding upon a solution - that an interesting ethical choice emerges.

Assuming I've already assessed the client's needs and considered various solutions, I now have to make a decision.  

# Choice One.
Offer my advice to the client about the best way to proceed. I choose *for* them. This method omits technical details from the conversation, and entrusts me, the developer, to handle the big-picture stuff.

***How It Might Sound**: "We should use WordPress to create your website because of its reliability. Let's use GoDaddy for hosting since it's affordable and easy to use."*

# Choice Two.
Explain the client's many options and allow them to choose. They make the choice. I include all technical details and let them pick.

***How It Might Sound**: "WordPress websites cost $X to develop and has access to hundreds of plugins. Rails websites cost $Y to develop and they allow for absolute customizability. You choose."*

Initially, **Choice Two** - allowing the client to choose - seemed the better choice. Under this configuration, I was performing my duty to the client by telling them about their options. The client then makes the final decision about how to proceed. 

This has a dual benefit for the developer: the client *gets what they want*, and I am free from liability should something go wrong. If they were unsatisfied with the end-product, I could defend myself with an indignant, "it was your decision to do it this way, not mine."

As an individual freelancer, this was very tempting. I soon realized that this was very wrong.

I had critically misinterpreted what I was offering. I wasn't simply selling a website, I was *selling my knowledge.* My experience. My value as a web developer was in my ability to juggle a variety of technical details so that my clients don't have to.

Should we use WordPress or SquareSpace? Or is a custom-built CMS the right way to go? Does the budget allow it? If so, Laravel or Ruby/Rails? GoDaddy or Namecheap? DigitalOcean droplet or Heroku or other? Bootstrap or Foundation? Which choices matter, which don't? Blah blah blah.

Sifting through these questions, determining which details are significant, and trying to piece together a coherent solution that efficiently, affordably, and elegantly addresses the client's problems - these are my skills. This is what I have to offer.

The website is a product that comes about as a result of a service, and that service is problem-solving.

## You Can Trust Me.

I've since changed my perspective. Shifting responsibility to my clients - a less-informed party when it comes to web development - is irresponsible; it is a cheap, cowardly way to claim innocence when something goes wrong. 

The best way to prevent unsatisfied clients is simply: be an expert. Do a great job. Rather than sneakily evading responsibility, it's my job to assume full responsibility so that the client doesn't have to - and use my knowledge to make the best choices I can, choices that make the client happy. 

Obviously, this isn't easy. I am passionate and obsessive about what I do, but I'm only human. I hold myself to the highest standard when it comes to creating websites. Lag upsets me. Misaligned columns bug me. But I'm only human. Every web design agency - from one man operations to 50+ employee operations - is fallible. And hey, you may prefer orange, where I prefer purple. As much as I try, the odds of me dropping a client's ideal website into their laps on my first try are pretty low. 

Web development is a give-and-take, an endeavor that is simultaneously concerned with immensely creative and technical questions. The difficulty of the pursuit makes it tempting to shield myself, as a developer, through whatever means I can. But protection for myself shouldn't come at the cost of the client's satisfaction.

The best way to protect myself, therefore, is to be as communicative as I can. By really speaking with the client, by striving to maintain the latest technical and ethical standards in my work, and by constantly exploring ways to improve - this is how I'll shield myself. By being great at what I do.

Again, it'll be hard. The web is an infinitely rich ecosystem that's always evolving, and it'll be a challenge to keep up with the best practices for each kind of site. Anyone who denies it is doing exactly that - denying the truth. But this is my job, and I'm excited to give it my best.

So whether you need a small-scale studio art portfolio, a photo-focused travel blog, a text-centric poetry archive, or a full-fledged e-commerce website, don't hesitate to give me a call.

I look forward to working with you.

Best,

Kevin Oh
