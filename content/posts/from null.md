# Null Hypothesis

This is an article about the difficulty of cooperation. So, instead of diving right in, let's randomly digress with a characterization of a few of my pals.

## James

I have a friend named James. Born in '88. His was the voice you heard humming in the background at parties, jumping from anecdote to anecdote. He was the fellow the shy girls avoided, for fear that he would publicly tease their outfit or hair. And indeed, his sharp wit made many enemies, even when applied in jest. But his crime, I would argue, wasn't indecency. They say that a good friend will bail you out of jail, while a best friend will be in jail right beside you, laughing hysterically and shouting, "damn, that was fun."

That was James.

He poked fun because he assumed you knew that he would do anything for you. While explicit reverence was hard-won, respect was always granted implicitly as soon as he learned your name. He exuded a sense of, "I'm imperfect, and so are you, and that's okay." He made you feel decidedly human, with all of its joys and awkwardness. And when it mattered, he was courteous to a fault. He made you feel like it was okay to make fun and be made fun of - because in the end, we're all trying to make it to 5PM.

To that end, he recently moved to LA to explore and hew out a career in acting. He commands rooms with the antics of a jester but the shrewd wisdom of a lawyer. James' domain of knowledge is, in a sense, people.

## Jenny

I have a friend named Jenny. When talking to her, the conversation teleports from topic to topic, often abruptly restarting with a "hi" - soon to tumble down another digression. She frequently asks how I'm doing, and if my response is anything short of overwhelmingly convincing, she'll go out of her way to send me reassuring quotes. On most days, she has an air of endearing awkwardness. To wit, I once spotted her at a cafe after six odd years. I stepped forward to say hi, and the ensuing conversation was littered with jabs of "this is so weird, you're so weird." I didn't know how to answer.

Jenny is a Cornell graduate. Medical student in her second year.
