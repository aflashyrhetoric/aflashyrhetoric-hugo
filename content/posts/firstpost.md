# Null Hypothesis

This is an article about the difficulty of cooperation. So, instead of diving right in, let's randomly digress with a characterization of two very interesting people in my life.

## James

I have a friend named James. Born in '88. His was the voice you heard humming in the background at parties, jumping from anecdote to anecdote. He was, in many ways, "that guy" - the one shy girls avoided, for fear that he would publicly tease their outfit or hair. And indeed, his sharp wit made him many enemies. But his crime, I would argue, wasn't indecency or brutishness or callousness. 

They say that a good friend will bail you out of jail, while a best friend will be in jail right beside you, laughing hysterically and shouting, "damn, that was fun."

That was James.

He poked fun because he assumed you knew that he would do anything for you. While true deference was hard won, respect was always granted implicitly as soon as he learned your name. He exuded a sense of, "I'm imperfect, and so are you, and that's okay." He made you feel decidedly human, with all of its joys and awkwardness. And when it mattered, he was courteous to a fault. He made you feel like it was okay to have fun - and be made fun of - because in the end, we're all trying to make it to 5PM.

To that end, he recently moved to LA to explore and hew out a career in acting. He commands rooms with the antics of a jester, but the judiciousness of a lawyer. James' domain of knowledge is, in a sense, people.

## Jenny

I have a friend named Jenny. I speak to her on occasion, but it's always a dizzying experience. The conversation teleports from topic to topic, often restarting with abrupt *hi*s or *hello*s, soon before teetering and tumbling down yet another digression. Digressions about the nutritional value of cheese, or about photos of shiba inus superimposed onto burritos. 

She always asks how I'm doing, and if my answer is anything short of overwhelmingly convincing, she'll go out of her way to send me reassuring quotes. Jenny's a bit awkward. To wit, I once saw her at a cafe after six years. I said hi, and the ensuing conversation was littered with "this is so weird, you're so weird." I didn't know how to respond to this, so I kept nodding. 

But it isn't the sheepish, fidgety awkwardness you'd find in a fourth grade classroom. It's the kind of awkwardness worn by those whose thoughts buzz around so ceaselessly that they simply don't pay attention to the minute behaviors that would constitute *being cool*. They just don't care, the way a fighter pilot wouldn't care if his socks don't quite match. 

Jenny is a Cornell graduate. Medical student in her second year. As such, she shoulders an intensely disciplined studying routine. It's as if somebody installed the engine of a Ferrari into the diminutive chassis of a Prius. I don't ask what she's up to anymore, because the answer has consistently come back the same for years: "studying." 

Jenny's domain of knowledge is, quite explicitly, medicine.

## Imagination Time

Let's explore a scenario. We'll pluck Jenny from the library and James from his latest bacchanlian haunt, and drop them both in a room. Let's imagine a bell *dings* somewhere in the distance.

Round One. Their task: plan an awesome wedding. 

James turns to Jenny. "Uh, you got this," he says. She rolls her eyes and starts compiling a list of major tasks that need to be done:

    - Choose a date & time
    - Choose a venue
    - Create a budget

As she scribbles away, he twiddles his thumbs. "Come onnnn," he pleads, "is there something for me to do?" She politely nods no, and he shrinks into himself, nodding off from boredom. 

"Done," she says authoritatively. James stands up, rubbing the sleep from his eyes, and sees an immaculate spreadsheet with an itemized budget, a comparison of 6 potential venues across 10 data points, and a long list of invitees. It's Jenny's turn to rest, and she slumps into a nearby chair.

"But what about the invitations themselves?" he asks.

"I don't know. You handle it," she replies.

"And the seating arrangements?"

"Handle it," she repeats flatly, her eyes already closing from exhaustion.

His eyes return to the spreadsheets and graphs and charts. He sighs. This isn't what he does. He *could*, of course, but he'd slog through it like homework. It wasn't interesting to him, and it wasn't his style. He believed in spontaneity, and was hesitant to accept the idea of *planned fun*. Partitioning the richness of life and people, planning it with a ruler, and sorting it into little boxes to be enjoyed later like rations. He wasn't a blind idealist, but there was a part of him that wished that everyone was so rich that the task of *making a budget* was never performed again. 

---

When Jenny wakes, she sees a stack of beautiful invitations, each masterfully calligraphed with the invitee's name and address. She's impressed.

She stares down at the budgeting chart she made earlier and sees an unexpected entry:

> Hire calligrapher to create invitations - $1400

She angrily summons James, who admits he simply hired out the task of creating invitations.

"$1400? This cuts into our budget a *lot*." She emphasizes each word like a punchy staccato.

Jenny runs her eyes over the spreadsheets for ten minutes then quietly says, "we'll just have to settle for the tilapia instead of the steak. They're not going to like this." Already, her mind's eye turns to the judgmental glare of disappointed wedding guests.

She faces James, who is twiddling his thumbs madly once again. "Did you at least handle the seating arrangements?" His silence is answer enough. She whips up a seating arrangement in a hurry.

The day of the wedding is here. The bride and groom are wed and the reception is about to begin. It's go time. James, decked out in a s
