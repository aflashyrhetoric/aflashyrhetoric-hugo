# Pardons

> When everything is entirely and absolutely subjective, no corrective action can be justified. 

// Potential beginning point #1
Let's perform a thought experiment.

There's a patient and a doctor.

Case 1. The patient is sick, the doctor cures him. All is well.

Case 2. The patient is sick, but does not want to be cured. The doctor is faced with a moral dilemma. Given the existence of things like DNRs - for Do Not Resuscitate - this seems to be a dilemma long ago resolved, with the conclusion that our life is our own, and it is up to us to decide what to do with it.

Case 3. The patient is sick with a highly infectious, highly deadly disease, but does not want to be cured. Because he poses a grand threat to society, I have no doubt that we would forcibly quarantine this individual. His rights to his body and lifestyle choices matter less than the overall welfare of society. 

Case 4. The patient is sick with a cold - highly infectious, but symptomatically insignificant and non-lethal. And oddly, they don't want to be cured. Perhaps they're too proud to admit they've caught *the bug. What then? Do we ask them to cover their mouths when coughing? What if asking them to do so would insult their personal choice to cough freely? 

Well - it's ludicrous, of course. Of course we'd tell them to cover their mouths, right? Because regardless of the severity of the lethality of the disease, the principle is the same: this man's individual right to his lifestyle matters less than the overall welfare of society, even if the *threat* to welfare was nothing more than a sniffle and a cough. Additionally, asking him to make a few small corrections to his behavior is, in no way, a valid threat to his lifestyle choices. And hell, even if it did "qualify as a threat," we would expect him to make a small sacrifice as a courtesy, right?

// Potential beginning point #2
I'd like to propose that we've begun to conflate *lifestyle choices* with *human rights* to disastrous effect. I believe we've accepted nuance in matters that are absolute, and absolutes in matters that are far more nuanced. I believe we've issued far too many pardons of abusive behavior whose sole defense was, "it is my culture."

First, let's differentiate between lifestyle choices that are inconsequential and lifestyle choices that are consequential.

Inconsequential lifestyle choices would be something like choosing Colgate toothpaste over Crest. It affects only you. Words like *preference* come into play.

Consequential lifestyle choices affect others in some way. 

// Potential beginning point #3
Let's start with the most controversial bit first: I do not believe that all cultures are made equal. To clarify: I think that members of all cultures deserve equal right to life, equal opportunity, and an equal ability to participate in activities, traditions, and rituals that give their lives purpose and/or brings them happiness.


However, by several metrics, I think some cultures can be more harmful than others.
